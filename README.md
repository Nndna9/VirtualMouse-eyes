# Virtual Mouse 🖱️👀

This mouse uses your Eyes as a mouse. Here we use our Right eye for navigation and Left eye for clicking. By winking with our left eye we can click.


## Usage
Running VirtualMouse.py
To use the virtual mouse, you can run the VirtualMouse.py script:


```
python VirtualMouse.py
```
This script allows you to control the mouse using your eyes.

## Requirements 

We need a python IDE ( I'm using PyCharm 2023.3)

### Packages installed

1. Cv2

2. MediaPipe

3. PyautoGui


Feel free to explore, fork and modify the main.py script to suit your specific requirements.
